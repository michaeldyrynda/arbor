## [0.14.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- **Copy-on-write (CoW) workspace mode** - New alternative to git worktrees that uses filesystem-level cloning. On APFS (macOS) and Btrfs/XFS (Linux), new workspaces are created instantly and share disk blocks with the source until files are actually modified. Falls back to a regular copy on unsupported filesystems with a clear warning.
- **`workspace_mode` config field** - Set `workspace_mode: cow` or `workspace_mode: worktree` in `arbor.yaml` to declare the project's workspace strategy. Existing projects without this field continue using worktree mode unchanged.
- **`arbor init --mode` flag** - Choose workspace mode at init time with `--mode cow` or `--mode worktree`. When running interactively, Arbor prompts for the preferred mode with a description of each option.
- **`arbor switch` command** - Bidirectional conversion between workspace modes (`arbor switch cow` or `arbor switch worktree`). Lists feature workspaces that will be removed, prompts for confirmation, then converts the full project layout including `.bare`/`.arbor` directories and `arbor.yaml`. Supports `--force` to skip confirmation.
- **`internal/workspace` package** - New mode-agnostic abstraction layer (`Manager`, `FindProjectRoot`, `CreateWorkspace`, `RemoveWorkspace`, `ListWorkspaces`, `ListWorkspacesDetailed`) used by all CLI commands. Both modes share the same command surface.
- **CoW filesystem detection** - `workspace.DetectCowSupport()` probes the filesystem at init/switch time and warns if native CoW is unavailable, rather than failing silently.

### Changed

- **All commands are now workspace-mode-aware** - `arbor work`, `arbor remove`, `arbor list`, `arbor prune`, `arbor destroy`, `arbor sync`, and `arbor pull-config` work identically in both worktree and CoW mode.
- **Project detection supports both markers** - `FindProjectRoot()` searches parent directories for `.bare/` (worktree mode) or `.arbor/` (CoW mode). `.bare/` takes precedence when both are present for backward compatibility.
- **`arbor sync` uses workspace git directory** - In CoW mode (no bare repo), sync operations run against the current workspace's `.git` directory rather than a shared bare repo.

## [0.13.2] - 2026-03-03

### Changed

- **Migration prompt now shows the target database name** - When multiple `db.create` steps are configured (e.g. with `--prefix app`, `--prefix quotes`, `--prefix knowledge`), each migration confirmation prompt now includes the full database name (e.g. `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed on app_swift_runner`) so you can distinguish between repeated prompts.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed

- **`arbor work` detached HEAD from remote branches** - When selecting a remote branch (e.g. `origin/feature/foo`) from the interactive list, the worktree was created in detached HEAD state and not visible in `arbor list`. The remote prefix is now stripped to create a proper local tracking branch.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added

- **`--skip-scaffold` flag for `arbor work`** - Skip scaffold steps when creating a worktree, consistent with the existing `--skip-scaffold` behaviour on `arbor init`. Run `arbor scaffold <branch>` afterwards to scaffold manually.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- **`arbor pull-config` command** - Copy arbor.yaml from the default branch worktree to the project root. Simplifies propagating team config changes without manual file copying.
- **Pull-config flags** - Support for `--force/-f` (skip confirmation), `--dry-run` (preview changes), `--verbose/-v` (detailed output), and `--quiet/-q` (suppress non-essential output).

## [0.11.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- **Interactive database reuse** - When `db.create` runs in interactive mode, Arbor scans sibling worktrees for existing databases and lets you choose to reuse one instead of creating a fresh database. Useful for stacked PRs where branches share data.
- **Migration confirmation prompt** - After database creation or reuse, `db.create` prompts whether to run `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed`. Declining skips the migration step entirely.
- **Database drop confirmation** - `db.destroy` now prompts for confirmation before dropping databases in interactive mode, preventing accidental data loss when databases may be shared between worktrees.
- **`context_var` condition type** - New scaffold step condition that checks runtime context variables, enabling steps to be conditionally skipped based on choices made earlier in the scaffold flow.
- **`--force` / `-f` flag for `arbor scaffold`** - Skip confirmation prompts when running scaffold non-interactively.

### Fixed

- Symlink resolution in worktree path comparison so the current worktree is correctly excluded from database reuse candidates on macOS (where `/var` resolves to `/private/var`).
- `arbor scaffold` now correctly respects `--no-interactive` and `--force` flags for all prompts, not just step execution.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-02-05

### Performance

- **Significantly improved `arbor sync` auto-stash performance** - Changed auto-stash to skip ignored files (node_modules, vendor, etc.) for much faster operation
  - Auto-stash now completes in seconds instead of minutes on large projects
  - Changed from `git stash push --all` to `git stash push --include-untracked`
  - Still protects tracked modifications and untracked files
  - Ignored files are safely skipped since git doesn't modify them during sync anyway
